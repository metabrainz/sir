MusicBrainz Database Schema
----

Of course you'll need a MusicBrainz database somewhere to read the data from.
The active database schema sequence must be `30` (or any future schema version
if still compatible). Follow `announcements`_ from the MetaBrainz blog.

Only Sir `4.y.z` is able to read from database of schema sequence `30`
(or any future schema if still compatible, but it reads and sends the
data made available from schema sequence `30` only).
